# pukaipu
pukaipu is a secure, per-user remote browser + terminal environment built on Xpra, Qtile, and Brave, designed to run multiple isolated instances on a single host — one container per user.

Each instance:
 * runs under its own Unix user (UID 3000–4000 range)
 * exposes a browser-based desktop over HTTPS/WebSocket
 * uses client-certificate authentication
 * is hardened with seccomp + AppArmor
 * persists user state in the user’s host home directory

⸻

Features
 * 🔒 Strong isolation
Per-user UID/GID, seccomp profile, AppArmor profile.
 * 🧑‍💻 One user = one container
Clean mapping: /home/<user> → /data/home inside container.
 * 🌐 Remote browser desktop
Brave + Qtile streamed via Xpra HTML5 client.
 * 🧾 Client certificate auth
Self-signed root CA, per-user client cert (client.p12).
 * 🔁 Reproducible builds
docker compose up --build always rebuilds from the repo.
 * 🛠 Idempotent provisioning
Running the setup script twice does not overwrite existing instances.

⸻

Requirements
 * Linux host (tested on Debian)
 * Docker or Podman
 * AppArmor enabled
 * Root access (for user creation & profiles)

⸻

Quick start

Clone the repo to a central location on the host:

```
git clone https://github.com/scuq/pukaipu.git
cd pukaipu
```

Create a new user instance:

```
sudo ./create-instance.sh john --fqdn john.example.org
```

Start it:

```
cd /opt/pukaipu/john
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open in browser:

```
https://john.example.org:<assigned-port>
```

Import the generated client certificate (client.p12) into your browser
→ the passphrase is printed once on first startup.

```

User data lives in:

```

├── .config/qtile
├── .config/kitty

└── brave-profile
```

Security model (high level)
 * Container runs as non-root user
 * No shared volumes between users
 * Client cert required to connect
 * seccomp restricts syscalls (Chrome-aware)
 * AppArmor profile allows user namespaces but blocks everything else


What this is (and isn’t)

✅ Great for:
 * secure remote browsing
 * admin jump environments
 * sandboxed access to untrusted sites
 * per-user ephemeral desktops

❌ Not intended as:
 * a multi-user desktop inside one container
 * a full VDI replacement
 * a Wayland-native environment (Xpra/X11-based)
